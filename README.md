This repository is an end-to-end Azure Data Engineering starter that provisions infrastructure with Terraform (ADLS Gen2, Key Vault, Databricks workspace, optional networking), bootstraps Unity Catalog (metastore, storage credentials, external locations, catalogs/schemas, grants), and ships a Databricks Asset Bundles (DAB) setup for repeatable job/pipeline deployments. It includes sample PySpark pipelines, environment configs (dev/test/prod), and a CI/CD workflow so teams can clone, parameterize, and ship governed lakehouse projects quickly.
